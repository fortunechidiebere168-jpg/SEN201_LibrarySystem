## 📖 Project Overview
The **Professional Library Management System (LMS)** is a Python-based application designed to manage library operations efficiently.  
The system allows librarians to manage books and students, issue and return books, track availability, and search for books.

This project demonstrates the **full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** from requirement analysis to deployment.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To apply SDLC concepts to a real-world project  
- To design and implement a modular software system  
- To demonstrate the use of GitHub for version control  
- To build a maintainable and extendable Python application  

---

## ⚙️ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis
The system should be able to:
- Add and remove books
- Register students
- Issue books to students
- Return issued books
- Track book availability
- Search books by title or author
- Maintain a record of issued books

---

### 2️⃣ System Design
The system is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

#### Main Classes:
- **Book**
- **Student**
- **Library**

Each class represents a real-world entity and contains relevant attributes and methods.

---

### 3️⃣ Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using separate modules for clarity and maintainability.

#### Project Structure:

---

### 4️⃣ Testing
The system was tested by:
- Adding multiple books and students
- Issuing and returning books
- Searching for books
- Verifying correct status updates

---

### 5️⃣ Deployment
The project is deployed using **GitHub** as the version control platform.  
All source code files are pushed to a public GitHub repository.

---

### 6️⃣ Maintenance
The system is designed to be easily extendable.  
Future improvements may include:
- Database integration
- User authentication
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Web-based implementation

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- Book management
- Student registration
- Book issue and return system
- Book availability tracking
- Search functionality
- Modular and clean code structure
